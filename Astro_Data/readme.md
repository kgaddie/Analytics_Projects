## Project: Astro Data - Gaia Mission Data Exploration with AstroQuery

### Description
Gaia, the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics, is a European Space Agency astronomical observatory mission. Its goal is to create the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of the Milky Way by surveying about 1% of the galaxy's 100 billion stars. The satellite returned a large amount of data which is publicly available using the astroquery package in python. This notebook will focus on the interaction and analysis of data from the second data release from the Gaia mission.

The selected language for this project was Python, broken up into a Jupyter Notebook outlining the various components of the project: AstroSql data pull, visualizing data, and various calculations of Astronomical Data.

### Files Included

##### Data
Included in this section are two base files used for Isochrone & Photometry visualizations
 
##### Gaia.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook outlines the various ways that one can use AstroSQL to interact with Gaia mission data. Futher explored in this notebook are various ways to calculate aspects of astronomical data and visualize stars found in the Gaia mission.
