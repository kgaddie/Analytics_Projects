## distillery_database: Whiskey Distillery & Tasting Database
Skills: webscraping, geolocation data, Google Development APIs

This project involves Web Scraping and use of Geolocation Data to gather a list of all Whisky Distilleries in the world, searching and assigning geolocation coordinates (latitude/longitude by address or country), and compiling into a base dataset for ingestion into a Tableau Dashboard. Additional development involves the incorporation of Google Form created data for tasting notes to create a mass dataframe of tasting notes to be used in a Tableau Dashboard.

## Titanic Project
Skills: EDA, Model Building, Model Evaluation

This project outlines the work done to solve and present a solution to the Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The goal of this competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The selected language for this project was Python, broken up in to a series of Jupyter Notebooks outlining the various components of the project: EDA, Model Building, and Model Evaluation.
