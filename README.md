## Astro_Data: Gaia Mission Data Exploration with AstroQuery
Skills: AstroSql, Visualizing Data

Gaia, the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics, is a European Space Agency astronomical observatory mission. Its goal is to create the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of the Milky Way by surveying about 1% of the galaxy's 100 billion stars. The satellite returned a large amount of data which is publicly available using the astroquery package in python. This notebook will focus on the interaction and analysis of data from the second data release from the Gaia mission.

## distillery_database: Whiskey Distillery & Tasting Database
Skills: webscraping, geolocation data, Google Development APIs

This project involves Web Scraping and use of Geolocation Data to gather a list of all Whisky Distilleries in the world, searching and assigning geolocation coordinates (latitude/longitude by address or country), and compiling into a base dataset for ingestion into a Tableau Dashboard. Additional development involves the incorporation of Google Form created data for tasting notes to create a mass dataframe of tasting notes to be used in a Tableau Dashboard.

## Titanic Project
Skills: EDA, Model Building, Model Evaluation

This project outlines the work done to solve and present a solution to the Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The goal of this competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The selected language for this project was Python, broken up in to a series of Jupyter Notebooks outlining the various components of the project: EDA, Model Building, and Model Evaluation.
