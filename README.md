## distillery_database: Whiskey Distillery & Tasting Database
Skills: webscraping, geolocation data, Google Development APIs

This project involves Web Scraping and use of Geolocation Data to gather a list of all Whisky Distilleries in the world, searching and assigning geolocation coordinates (latitude/longitude by address or country), and compiling into a base dataset for ingestion into a Tableau Dashboard. Additional development involves the incorporation of Google Form created data for tasting notes to create a mass dataframe of tasting notes to be used in a Tableau Dashboard.
